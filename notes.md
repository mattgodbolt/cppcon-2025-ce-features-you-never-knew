### Title: "Compiler Explorer: Features You Never Knew Existed"

### Abstract

Remember when Compiler Explorer just showed assembly code? Those innocent days are long gone. What started as a simple "what does my compiler do?" tool (in bash!) has morphed into 100,000 lines of TypeScript powering 100 million compilations a year. It runs CUDA on actual GPUs, tests your code against 10 compilers simultaneously, and maintains 3,000+ compiler versions that refuse to retire. Join me as we excavate CE's archaeological layers of features, from ones you probably know about ("it can run code!"), through the mysterious Conformance Viewer and IDE mode, to the fun and interesting visualisations of your compiler's output. 

We'll uncover the features hiding in plain sight: arbitrary subdomain URLs (badger.godbolt.org works!), keyboard shortcuts that make you look like a wizard, and the optimization pipeline viewer that shows exactly how -O3 turns your careful algorithms into three assembly instructions. I'll reveal how every short link lasts forever, how we safely run arbitrary code from the internet, and how we squeeze 80+ languages into $3,000/month of infrastructure. Whether you're a CE power user or someone who just discovered the Executor view, you'll learn about some pretty cool features you never knew existed! (Honestly neither did I until I started preparing this talk!)
